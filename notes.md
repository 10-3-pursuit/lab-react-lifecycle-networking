## useState in Employee.jsx

The line `const [showPets, setShowPets] = useState(false);` is used to initialize a piece of state in your React component, and it's specifically for managing whether the pets related to an employee should be shown or not. Here's the breakdown of why the initial state is set to `false`:

1. **useState Hook**: `useState` is a React hook that lets you add state to functional components. In class components, you would normally use `this.state` and `this.setState`, but hooks provide a more convenient and cleaner way to handle state in functional components.

2. **Initial State as `false`**: The value you pass to `useState` is the initial value of the state. In this case, `false` is used as the initial value for `showPets`.

3. **Toggle Functionality**: The `setShowPets` function returned by `useState` is used to toggle the state. When the user clicks the button to show or hide pets, this function is called to update `showPets` between `true` and `false`, triggering a re-render of the component with the new state.

In summary, initializing `showPets` to `false` is a logical choice for controlling the visibility of additional information in a UI, ensuring that such information is hidden by default and only shown upon user action. This enhances the user experience by keeping the interface clean and uncluttered initially.
